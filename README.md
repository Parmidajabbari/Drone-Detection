# Drone Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on **drone detection** using deep learning and computer vision techniques. The model is designed to detect drones in aerial footage and classify them accurately in real-time.

## Features
- **Real-time drone detection** using a trained deep learning model.
- **Frame-by-frame analysis** for object tracking.
- **High accuracy** with minimal false positives.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of aerial images and videos containing:
- **Labeled drone instances** for supervised learning.
- **Various environmental conditions** to improve robustness.
- **Augmented data** to enhance model generalization.

## Model Architecture
The system integrates:
- **Object Detection Model**: Uses a deep learning-based detection network for drone identification.
- **Feature Extraction**: Leverages convolutional layers for accurate classification.
- **Post-processing**: Applies filtering techniques to minimize false detections.

## Results
The system was tested on real-world aerial videos, achieving:
- **High detection accuracy** with minimal false positives.
- **Robust performance** across different lighting conditions.
- **Efficient processing speed** for real-time deployment.

## Installation
To run the project locally, install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib torch torchvision
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook for detection and analysis:
```sh
jupyter notebook Drone_Detection.ipynb
```

## Future Improvements
- Improve detection accuracy with **more training data**.
- Optimize performance for **embedded systems**.
- Implement **multi-object tracking** for swarm detection.
